## Files
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main source files included in this project are:

QuoridorGame.java  : This is the main controller of the Quoridor game. It handles player turns, input validation, move and wall logic, and the game loop. It also integrates global statistics and ensures a consistent user interface experience.

QuoridorBoard.java  : Represents the game board structure. It manages pawn and wall placements, board rendering, and wall blocking logic.

QuoridorRules.java  : Contains all movement and rule validation logic. It ensures that each move follows the official Quoridor game rules, including jump and diagonal move cases.
Pawn.java  : Defines the pawn object for each player, including its identity and position tracking on the board.

Position.java  : Represents a coordinate pair (row, column) on the board, used by both pawns and walls for movement and placement.

WallPiece.java : Describes the wall object, including its position and orientation (horizontal or vertical)


## Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.The program supports both 2-player and 4-player modes, with automatic pawn placement and individual wall limits
2.Implemented a custom game loop so that invalid actions (illegal moves or wall placements) do not skip the playerâ€™s turn
3.Integrated global statistics tracking, recording each playerâ€™s total games, wins, average moves, and average time
4.Added color-enhanced terminal display to make turns, errors, and results more readable and engaging
5.Carefully designed rule validation logic in QuoridorRules.java, including jump-over and diagonal move handling when pawns face each other
6.The design ensures compatibility with previous assignments(A1 and A2) without breaking shared components such as Game, Player, and TextUI



## How to compile and run
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your directions on how to run the code. Make sure to be as thorough as possible!
